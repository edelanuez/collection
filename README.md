A collection of my mggg ranking musings over the summer

here is the general list of things I did with ranking systems this summer:
1. data visualization:
  a.   rcv_data_vis.py is a file that just has a whole bunch of code for different types of graphs for ranked choice voting as it relates to fringe candidates for the Minnesota election.
        In particular, the goody in this file is the accumulation graph.
  b. Accumulation chart workflow is a pdf that just walks through how to make an accumulation graph with the rcv_data_viz
  c. Fringe candidates.py is a simple scatter plot of the swap distance for the Minnesota election with regards to how many fringe candidates were removed from the candidate list.
2. fringe candidate musings:
  a. pseudo code for automating stv is an inappropriately named pdf that actually charts out some pseudo-code for how to think about fringe candidates.
  Given the ill-natured name, expect this to be a bit half-baked. 
  b. MINN.Fringe.py is a file that has the actual implementation of fringe candidates plus Kendall tau distance.
  c.  fringe candidate votes.py is a more half-baked file of how to implement fringe candidates.
